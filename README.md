# Lab experiments/notes

This is a repository that contains all the lab experiments and notes from various subjects.
I have created this to help engineering students doing their major in computer engineering with lap experiments and related notes.

### Note:
Files with "SE" or "FE" etc prepended to its file name means the following 

FE - First year  
SE - Second year  
TE - Third year  
BE - Fourth year
